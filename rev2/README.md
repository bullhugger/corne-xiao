# CORNE-XIAO

### Pcb 

[Here](/rev2/PCB) you can find the Gerbers for the corne-xiao.

### Case and Switch-plate

The pcb has the same dimensions and mounting points of the corne-cherry by foostan. So it will work with all the corne cases with the following constraint : **Since the controller is mounted facing up and is different from pro micro, make sure the case has clearance for the usb port**.

_Corne v4 plates/cases will not fit as it has different spacing from the previous versions._

I have also shared files for a case that I personally use [here](/case).

### Build Guide

While the build process is similar to most of the keyboards, you can refer to the [build guide](/rev2/docs/buildguide.md) to solder jumpers and other extra stuff.

### Firmware

Firmware for both [5-col](/rev2/firmware/5-col) and [6-col](/rev2/firmware/6-col) has been shared which supports encoders on both half by default. 
If you are going for nice!view instead of encoder, you can find the firmware [here](https://github.com/sidx64/corne-zmk-enc-nview), courtesy of [sidx64](https://github.com/sidx64).

The uf2 folder contains ready to flash files for each half with an additional settings-reset file that might come in help if you are facing issues with bluetooth.

By default, the firmware uses a [zmk-rgbled-widget](https://github.com/caksoylar/zmk-rgbled-widget) made by [caksoylar](https://github.com/caksoylar) to help with the bluetooth profile and battery status. In case you don't want to use the widget, you can remove the keyword `rgbled_adapter` from `build.yaml`.
